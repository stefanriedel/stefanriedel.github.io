### Description
- A 3D-Audio-Radioplay that lets the listener go through a portal and find itself in different abstract worlds of sound.
This piece was created within the sound design course at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. It was a group effort, to which I contributed sound design as well as many hours of mixing and arranging with Michael Romanov and others in the IEM Studio.
