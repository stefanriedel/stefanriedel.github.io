### Description
- A 3D-Audio-Radioplay that lets the listener go through a portal and find itself in different abstract worlds of sound.
This piece was created within the sound design course at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. It was a group effort, to which I contributed sound design as well as many hours of mixing and arranging with Michael Romanov and others in the IEM Studio. 
The piece was awarded silver in the category "Audio Drama" at the 2017 ICSA 3D audio production competition.
