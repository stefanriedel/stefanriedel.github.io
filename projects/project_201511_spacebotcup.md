### Responsibilities
- plugin for on-board process-/component-manager to publish process- and system health state over uni-directional channel (UDP-multicast) in order to monitor the robot given the communication constraints by the competition rules
- CLI-tools for displaying system status and interface for remote-control of the on-board process-/component-manager in order to (re)start/stop processes and subsystems
